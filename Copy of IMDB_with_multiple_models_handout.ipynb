This is a non-trivial task, since the concept of sentiment is not easily captured.\n","\n","For this assignment you have to use the larger [IMDB sentiment](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz) benchmark dataset from Stanford, an achieve close to state of the art results.\n","\n","The task is to try out multiple models in ascending complexity, namely:\n","\n","1. TFIDF + classical statistical model (eg. RandomForest)\n","2. LSTM classification model\n","3. LSTM model, where the embeddings are initialized with pre-trained GloVe vectors\n","4. fastText model\n","5.

After using the model for the task how well you evaluate the accuracy you got for each model and discuss the main advantages and disadvantages the model has in the particular modelling task. At best you take part of the modelling to support your arguments.\n","\n","(3) The consistency of your take-aways, i.e. what you have learned from your analyses. Also, analyze when the model is good and when and where it does not predict well.\n","\n","Please make sure that you comment with # on the separates steps of the code you have produced.
